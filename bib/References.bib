	abstract = {Stream cipher is an important branch of symmetric cryptosystems, which takes obvious advantages in speed and scale of hardware implementation. It is suitable for using in the cases of massive data transfer or resource constraints, and has always been a hot and central research topic in cryptography. With the rapid development of network and communication technology, cipher algorithms play more and more crucial role in information security. Simultaneously, the application environment of cipher algorithms is increasingly complex, which challenges the existing cipher algorithms and calls for novel suitable designs. To accommodate new strict requirements and provide systematic scientific basis for future designs, this paper reviews the development history of stream ciphers, classifies and summarizes the design principles of typical stream ciphers in groups, briefly discusses the advantages and weakness of various stream ciphers in terms of security and implementation. Finally, it tries to foresee the prospective design directions of stream ciphers.},

	abstract="CRYPTO 2008 saw the introduction of the hash function MD6 and of cube attacks, a type of algebraic attack applicable to cryptographic functions having a low-degree algebraic normal form over GF(2). This paper applies cube attacks to reduced round MD6, finding the full 128-bit key of a 14-round MD6 with complexity 222 (which takes less than a minute on a single PC). This is the best key recovery attack announced so far for MD6. We then introduce a new class of attacks called cube testers, based on efficient property-testing algorithms, and apply them to MD6 and to the stream cipher Trivium. Unlike the standard cube attacks, cube testers detect nonrandom behavior rather than performing key extraction, but they can also attack cryptographic schemes described by nonrandom polynomials of relatively high degree. Applied to MD6, cube testers detect nonrandomness over 18 rounds in 217 complexity; applied to a slightly modified version of the MD6 compression function, they can distinguish 66 rounds from random in 224 complexity. Cube testers give distinguishers on Trivium reduced to 790 rounds from random with 230 complexity and detect nonrandomness over 885 rounds in 227, improving on the original 767-round cube attack.",

   abstract = {Grain v1 is one of the 7 finalists selected in the final portfolio by the eSTREAM project. It has an elegant and compact structure, especially suitable for a constrained hardware environment. Though a number of potential weaknesses have been identified, no key recovery attack on the original design in the single key model has been found yet. In this paper, we propose a key recovery attack, called near collision attack, on Grain v1. The attack utilizes the compact NFSR-LFSR combined structure of Grain v1 and works even if all of the previous identified weaknesses have been sewed and if a perfect key/IV initialization algorithm is adopted. Our idea is to identify near collisions of the internal states at different time instants and restore the states accordingly. Combined with the BSW sampling and the non-uniform distribution of internal state differences for a fixed keystream difference, our attack has been verified on a reduced version of Grain v1 in experiments. An ex-trapolation of the results under some assumption indicates an attack on Grain v1 for any fixed IV in 2 71.4 cipher ticks after the pre-computation of 2 73.1 ticks, given 2 62.8-bit memory and 2 67.8 keystream bits, which is the best key recovery attack against Grain v1 so far. Hopefully, it provides some new insights on such compact stream ciphers.},
